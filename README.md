# License Manager

A SaaS-ready project that allows you to grant access to your private apps via licenses/keys. Each license can have an **expiry date** and a **device limit**.  
While designed primarily for Android apps, it can also be used on **iOS, macOS, or Windows**, as long as you can obtain a device identifier to enforce the device limit reliably.
